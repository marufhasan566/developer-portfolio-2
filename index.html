                        <h5>Vanilla JavaScript</h5>
                        <p>Vanilla is a term used in web development to refer to plain or basic JavaScript code without
                            any external libraries or frameworks. It means that the code is written solely with the use
                            of JavaScript language features, without any external assistance such as jQuery or React.

                        <h5>React</h5>
                        <p>React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with
                            frameworks like Next. js and Remix. Because React is only concerned with the user interface
                            and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing
                            and other client-side functionality.</p>

                        <h5>Node.js</h5>
                        <p>Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
                            scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate
                            dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.</p>

                        <h5>MongoDB</h5>
                        <p>MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database used for storing structured, semistructured, and
                            unstructured data. Instead of using tables, as in a traditional relational database, MongoDB
                            stores data in JSON documents organized into collections.</p>
